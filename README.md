Credit Card "Encryption" Script (Educational Purposes Only)-Sathvik Shetty
# Important Disclaimer

This script demonstrates a basic hashing approach, but it's NOT suitable for real-world credit card encryption. SHA-256 is a hashing algorithm, not an encryption algorithm, and it cannot be used to decrypt data. Secure credit card handling requires robust encryption (like AES) and secure key management practices.

# Functionality

This Python script takes a credit card number as input, validates it as a string, and then hashes it using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The resulting hash is a one-way transformation and cannot be used to recover the original credit card number.

# Security Concerns

Hashing vs. Encryption: SHA-256 is not secure for encryption. It's a one-way function, meaning you cannot retrieve the original data.
Storage: Even hashed data needs secure storage (e.g., Hardware Security Modules) to prevent unauthorized access.
Key Management: Encryption (if used) requires secure key generation, storage, and rotation.
# Alternatives

Payment Gateways: Consider established payment gateways that handle secure transactions and data storage according to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance.
Tokenization: Look into tokenization, where the gateway creates a unique token representing the card, reducing the need to store the full credit card number.
# Educational Use Only

This script is intended for educational purposes only to demonstrate basic hashing concepts. It should never be used for real-world credit card encryption due to the inherent security risks.
