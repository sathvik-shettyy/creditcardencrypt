# creditcardencrypt
This Python script attempts to encrypt credit card numbers using SHA-256 hashing. However, SHA-256 is not suitable for encryption due to its one-way nature and inability to decrypt data. It's recommended to use industry-standard encryption algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with secure key management for credit card protection.
